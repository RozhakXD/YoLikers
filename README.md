YoLikers is a safe and efficient tool to increase likes on Facebook posts. Using cookies from new Facebook accounts, it offers a secure login process, bypasses reCAPTCHA verification automatically, and provides a smooth, frictionless experience.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Use a new or secondary account to avoid security risks on your main profile.

## ‚ú® Features
- **Multiple Reaction Types**: Choose from LIKE, LOVE, CARE, HAHA, WOW, SAD, or ANGRY.
- **Secure Login**: Use Facebook cookies for seamless authentication.
- **Bypass reCAPTCHA**: Automated handling of verification challenges.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Clean, modern interface built with Rich library.

## üöÄ Installation & Usage
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Required libraries: `requests`, `rich`

### Steps
1. Clone the Repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/RozhakXD/YoLikers.git
    cd YoLikers
    ```
2. Install Dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Running The Tool:
    ```bash
    python Run.py
    ```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration
- **Update reCAPTCHA Key**: Replace the placeholder with your own:

    ```python
    self.KEY = '<YOUR_MULTIBOT_KEY>' # Register here: https://multibot.in/dashboard/signup.php
    ```

## üõ† Troubleshooting
- If an error occurs while logging in, you can use another Facebook account to log in, because not all accounts can log in.
- Make sure the post ID you entered is correct, can be seen by the public and can be liked by the public.
- If you fail to send a reaction, it is likely that you have reached the limit because each account can only send 10 submissions in one day.
- If an error occurs while bypassing the captcha, it is likely that the multibot server is having problems.
- If you only get a few reactions, this is due to the small number of Yolikers users.
